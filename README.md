# Ariana S. Huffmyer, PhD
*Research Scientist, University of Washington*   

I am a research scientist studying the effects of climate change on marine invertebrate physiology and early life history, with a particular interest in the formation of coral-algal symbiosis during coral development.

I use [open lab notebooks](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/) and GitHub to make data and code openly accessible.
